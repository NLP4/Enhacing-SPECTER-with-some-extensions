# Enhancing SPECTER with Some Extensions

Welcome to our GitHub repository, where we aim to enhance the SPECTER model with several extensions. Our work focuses on incorporating additional data sources, performing temporal paper classification, and exploring the use of SPECTER on other types of texts.

## Project Overview

SPECTER is a powerful tool designed for scientific documents, leveraging citation information to generate document embeddings. In this project, we broaden the horizons of SPECTER by introducing additional dimensions and capabilities to its structure.

## Key Areas of Work

1. **Incorporating Additional Data Sources:** We expanded SPECTER by incorporating other data sources to produce rich document embeddings.

2. **Temporal Paper Classification:** We introduced temporal weights in the paper classification process to enhance the accuracy of the classification task.

3. **Exploring the Use of SPECTER on Other Types of Texts:** We examined the application of SPECTER on non-scientific texts, demonstrating its potential for generalization across diverse text classification tasks.
